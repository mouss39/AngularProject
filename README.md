# AngularProject

it is a simple angular project that contains the main activities in any project.
The backend of the project is in the spring-boot-project repository in my profile. In order to lunch this project you should also have the backend and connect them(more info there).
Please keep in mind that this project is only an example, so I tend to show how to do things and show only the main fuctionalities. It is a demo project.
Code in the master branch.
